Description: Directed Dependence Coefficient (didec) is a measure of directed dependence. Multivariate Feature Ordering by Conditional Independence (MFOCI) is a variable selection algorithm based on didec. Hierarchical Variable Clustering (VarClustPartition) is a variable clustering method based on didec. For more information, see the paper by 
    Ansari and Fuchs (2024, <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2212.01621>), and the paper by 
    Fuchs and Wang (2024, <doi:10.1016/j.ijar.2024.109185>).

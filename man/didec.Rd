\title{Computes the directed dependence coefficient.}
\usage{
didec(X, Y, perm = FALSE, perm.method = c("decreasing"))
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix or data.frame/data.table. Contains the predictor vector X.}

\item{Y}{A numeric matrix or data.frame/data.table. Contains the response vector Y.}

\item{perm}{A logical. If \code{True} a version of \code{didec} is computed that takes into account the permutations (specified by \code{perm.method}) of the response variables.}

\item{perm.method}{An optional character string specifying a method for permuting the response variables. This must be one of the strings \code{"sample"}, \code{"increasing"}, \code{"decreasing"} (default) or \code{"full"}. The version \code{"full"} is invariant with respect to permutations of the response variables.}
}
\value{
The degree of directed dependence of the random vector Y on the random vector X.
}
\description{
The directed dependence coefficient (\code{didec}) estimates the degree of directed dependence of a random vector Y on a random vector X, based on an i.i.d. sample of (X,Y).
}
\details{
The directed dependence coefficient (didec) is an extension of Azadkia & Chatterjee's measure of directed dependence (Azadkia & Chatterjee, 2021) to a vector of response variables introduced in (Ansari & Fuchs, 2023).
Its calculation is based on the function \code{codec} which estimates Azadkia & Chatterjeeâ€™s measure of directed dependence and is provided in the R package \code{FOCI}.

By definition, \code{didec} is invariant with respect to permutations of the variables within the predictor vector X. Invariance with respect to permutations within the response vector Y is achieved by computing the arithmetic mean over all possible (or chosen) permutations.
In addition to the option \code{"full"} of running all \eqn{q!} permutations of \eqn{(1, ..., q)}, less computationally intensive options are also available (here, \eqn{q} denotes the number of response variables): a random selection of \eqn{q} permutations \code{"sample"}, cyclic permutations such as \eqn{(1,2,...,q)}, \eqn{(2,...,q,1)} either \code{"increasing"} or \code{"decreasing"}.
Note that when the number of variables \eqn{q} is large, choosing \code{"full"} may result in long computation times.
